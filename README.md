### Design of experiments

A series of notebooks that explores the theoretical fundamentals of the design and analysis of experiments, and code examples in R. 
The majority of theory content is obtained from the book "Design and analysis of experiments, Douglas C. Montgomery".
#### Theory

- [Introduction to design of experiments](https://github.com/victorviro/design_of_experiments/blob/master/1_design_of_experiments_introduction.ipynb)
- [Statistical concepts and comparative experiments with two samples](https://github.com/victorviro/design_of_experiments/blob/master/2_design_of_experiments_comparative_experiments.ipynb)
- [The analysis of variance (ANOVA) with one factor](https://github.com/victorviro/design_of_experiments/blob/master/3_design_of_experiments_single_factor.ipynb)
- [Randomized block designs](https://github.com/victorviro/design_of_experiments/blob/master/4_design_of_experiments_randomized_blocks.ipynb)
- [Factorial designs](https://github.com/victorviro/design_of_experiments/blob/master/5_design_of_experiments_factorial_designs.ipynb)
- [The analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)](https://github.com/victorviro/design_of_experiments/blob/master/6_design_experiments_analysis_covariance.ipynb)
