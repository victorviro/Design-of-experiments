# Statistics and probability

## Design of experiments

A series of notebooks that explore the theoretical fundamentals of the design and analysis of experiments with examples in R. 
Much theory content is obtained through the book "Design and analysis of experiments, Douglas C. Montgomery".

- [The analysis of variance (ANOVA) with one factor](https://github.com/victorviro/design_of_experiments/blob/master/3_design_of_experiments_single_factor.ipynb)
- [Randomized block designs](https://github.com/victorviro/design_of_experiments/blob/master/4_design_of_experiments_randomized_blocks.ipynb)
