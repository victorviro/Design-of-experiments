        " **Note**: Generally, small to moderate violations of the assumptions are not a major concern, but any failure of the independence assumption and strong indications of nonnormality should not be ignored. Both the significance level of the test and the ability to detect differences between the means will be adversely affected by departures from assumptions. Transformations are one approach to dealing with this problem. Nonparametric tests can also be used if the observations come from nonnormal populations (see the section \"Nonparametric tests\")."

This test can be implemented in python using the [`ttest_rel()`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ttest_rel.html) Scipy function.

Unlike the t-test of the previous sections, the test on means with known variances **does not require** the assumption of **sampling from normal populations**. We can use the CLT to justify an approximate normal distribution for the difference in sample means $y_1-y_2$, and [standarize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score#Z-test) this difference so the test statistic follows a standard normal distribution.\n",

        "**In some statistical models**, like analysis of the variance and regression models, we need to check the **normality assumption** of the residuals. We can check this assumption by plotting a **histogram** of the residuals. If the assumption on the errors is satisfied, this plot should look like a sample from a normal distribution centered at zero. Unfortunately, with small samples, considerable fluctuation in the shape of a histogram often occurs, so the appearance of a moderate departure from normality does not necessarily imply a serious violation of the assumptions. Gross deviations from normality are potentially serious and require further analysis. Another extremely useful procedure is to construct a [**normal probability plot**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_probability_plot) of the residuals.\n",

        "It can be useful in data analysis and modeling to better **understand the relationships between variables**. The statistical relationship between two variables is referred to as their **correlation**. A correlation could be positive, meaning both variables move in the same direction, or negative, meaning that when one variable’s value increases, the other variable's values decrease. Correlation can also be neutral or zero, meaning that the variables are unrelated.\n",

        "The covariance between the two variables is 389.75. We can see that it is positive, suggesting the variables change in the same direction as we expect. A problem with **covariance** is that it is **challenging to interpret**. The [**Pearson correlation coefficient**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient) can be used to **summarize the strength of the linear relationship between two data samples**. It is computed as the covariance of the two variables divided by the product of the standard deviation of each data sample (a normalized measurement of the covariance that gives an interpretable score). The correlation coefficient returns a value between -1 and 1 that represents the limits of correlation from a full negative correlation to a full positive correlation. A value below -0.5 or above 0.5 indicates a notable correlation, and a value below those values suggests a less notable correlation.\n",

        "Pearson correlation remains a consistent estimator of the population correlation even when the two variables are not bivariate normal. Even tests based on Pearson's correlation do not require normality if the samples are large enough because of the CLT.\n",
        "\n",
        "The more important issue is whether the relationship between the variables is actually linear. Pearsons correlation only describes the linear part of the relationship, whereas Spearman's rho (which we will see next) is an estimate of any monotonic relationship form.\n",
        "\n",

        "Two variables may be **related by a nonlinear relationship**, such that the relationship is stronger or weaker across the distribution of the variables. In this case, the [**Spearman's rank correlation coefficient**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman%27s_rank_correlation_coefficient) can be used to summarize the strength between the two data samples. This test of relationship can also be used if there is a linear relationship between the variables but will have slightly less power. As with the Pearson correlation coefficient, the scores are between -1 and 1 for perfectly negatively correlated variables and perfectly positively correlated respectively. Instead of calculating the coefficient using covariance and standard deviations on the samples themselves, these **statistics are calculated from the relative rank of values on each sample**. A linear relationship between the variables is not assumed, although a **[monotonic relationship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotonic_function)** (an increasing or decreasing relationship) is assumed. It is also useful with **ordinal data** and is **robust to outliers** (unlike Pearson correlation).\n"
